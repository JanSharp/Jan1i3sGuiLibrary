  Info:
    - IMPORTANT:
      This mod will be unsupported once flib is released
      (flib is a universal library)
      Reasons:
      While this mod simplifies guis in general, it also adds some complications
      For example migration.
      But also internally, for it to be "smart" and enable the features it has,
      it has to do a lot more work when creating and deleting gui elements.
      which is slow, and hurts performance when creating big, complex guis.
      Additionally the mod has to store a lot of data in 'global'.
      Which decreases save and load speed.
      Also, having data per gui element in global means it has to be cleaned up
      whenever a gui element gets destroyed, but gui elements can get destroyed
      without the mod knowing about it, which means there would have to be a
      periodic cleanup system running in the background (this is currently not even
      implemented).
      flib's gui module does less than this mod, which fixes all the issues this mod has.
      with the only downside of a bit less sugar for the programmer.

      With that out of the way, i may still implement all the missing features for this mod
      before unsupporting it, but no guarantees.
